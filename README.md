# SocialNetworkAnalysis_Final

The analysis was carried out in R. 

The aim of the Social Network Analysis project was to write and algorithm that would output a sorted list of preferred itineraries between any two cities served by either Delta, United, or American Airlines. Interactive network visualizations (Route maps) were also created using plotly.
